## Hi! I'm Matías
I'm a Chilean roboticist 🇨🇱🤖 and postdoctoral researcher at the [Oxford Robotics Institute](https://ori.ox.ac.uk). I currently work in the [Dynamic Robot Systems group](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/drs) on robot navigation for inspection and monitoring missions in the wild. I'm broadly interested in perception and navigation, as well as fundamental methods. I also enjoy teaching, and try to understand things deeply.
