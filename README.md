## Hi! I'm Matías
I'm a Chilean roboticist 🇨🇱🤖 and a Research Associate at the [School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh](https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk), working in the Centre for AI in Assistive Autonomy.

Before, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Oxford Robotics Institute](https://ori.ox.ac.uk), working with the [Dynamic Robot Systems group](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/drs) on robot navigation for inspection and monitoring missions in the wild. I finished my [PhD on robot navigation](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:0bea8bec-f756-49ce-9cf3-114a96896c78) in 2023 with the same group.

I'm interested in the fundaments and systems for autonomy---from perception to decision-making. I also enjoy teaching, and try to understand things deeply.
